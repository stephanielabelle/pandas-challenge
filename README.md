## PyCity School Analysis

This project will attempt to draw conclusions about student performance in the PyCity School System.  
It will utilize metrics on school type, funding, size, and standardized testing scores to find trends in school performance.  
This project will be useful to the PyCity School Board and Mayor to aid in future strategic decisions. 

The files used for this project are located in the 'Resources' folder.  The [school](PyCitySchools/Resources/schools_complete.csv) csv file and [student](PyCitySchools/Resources/students_complete.csv) csv file were merged for this project.

5. Math Scores by Grade
