## PyCity School Analysis

This project will attempt to draw conclusions about student performance in the PyCity School System.  
It will utilize metrics on school type, funding, size, and student scores.  
This analysis will be provided to the school board and mayor to aid in future strategic decisions. 

The files used for this analysis are located in the 'Resources' folder.  The [school](PyCitySchools/Resources/schools_complete.csv) csv file and [student](PyCitySchools/Resources/students_complete.csv) csv file were merged for this project.

The [analysis file](/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools.ipynb) contains DataFrames describing:
1. District Summary
2. School Summary
3. Highest-Performing Schools
4. Lowest-Performing Schools
5. Math Scores by Grade
6. Reading Scores by Grade
7. Scores by School Spending
8. Scores by School Size
9. Scores by School Type
